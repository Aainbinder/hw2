    <h2>Stacks on Stacks was born of a simple dream...</h2>

    <p>...We simply wanted to be able to have All-You-Can-Eat pancakes without subjecting ourselves to an IHOP.<br>
    To be able to enjoy our food at a restaurant with a Health Rating higher than a Waffle House. <br>
    The comfort of sitting down for a meal at your in-laws' house, but without it being a Denny's. <br>
    So, the next time you're driving home at 4AM with a hankering for something delicious, let <em>Stacks on Stacks</em> be your <b>S.o.S!</b>
